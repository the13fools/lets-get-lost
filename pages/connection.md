Thank you for making it this far!  I hope you enjoyed the site.  This is the page on which I make it easy for you, the reader, to contribute.  

The easiest way is to opt in to hearing about future foolish projects - just enter your email address [here](http://foolzone.com/).  

I would also appreciate it if you spread word of this site to your friends/co-workers/acquaintances/neighborhood gutter punks/social media connections!  

If you have ideas for potential collaborations or want to otherwise contribute, contact <a href="mailto:fool@topazanodizing.com?Subject=Let's%20be%20friends!" target="_top">fool@topazanodizing.com</a>.  

I am interested in running this class again now that a detailed set of notes exists.  It has the promise to produce all manner of interesting artifacts. If you or someone you know could facilitate this (or could provide a workshop to prototype a totally different class), I'd love to hear from you.
