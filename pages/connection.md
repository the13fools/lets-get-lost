Thank you for making it this far!  I hope you enjoyed the site.  This is the page on which I make it easy for you, the reader, to contribute.  

The easiest way is to opt in to hearing about future foolish projects - just enter your email address [here](http://foolzone.com/).  

I would also appreciate it if you spread word of this site to your friends/co-workers/acquaintances/neighborhood gutter punks/social media connections!  

If you have ideas for potential collaborations or want to financially contribute, contact <a href="mailto:fool@foolzone.com?Subject=Let's%20be%20friends!" target="_top">fool@foolzone.com</a>.  With regard to opportunities, I'd love the to run this class again now that a detailed set of notes exists.  I think it would help clarify things, and I bet it would end up somewhere interesting.  There are also a few other tangential workshops that I think would be fun to prototype given the right setting/audience.
