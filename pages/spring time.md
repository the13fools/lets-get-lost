The previous section referenced a whirlwind of technical ideas and developed a code framework which implements them.  

Now it is time to gain experience and mastery of those ideas through play and demos!  

# Under Pressure

Once you have spent enough time playing with the previous example, you might become interested in connecting a few springs together to see what happens.  One such thing you can do is to connect the springs together between two fixed points (as demonstrated [here](http://www.acs.psu.edu/drussell/Demos/multi-dof-springs/multi-dof-springs.html), as an aside [Dan Russell](http://www.acs.psu.edu/drussell/demos.html) has a very full collection of animations which are worth exploring).

  
The one thing to do with a system that simulates spring physics is to connect a few springs together.
