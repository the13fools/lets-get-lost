In the previous section, we took our physical model, and did some technical computer work to place it in a context where it is possible to percieve data in an extra dimension.  

In this section, we will then experiment with ways in which we can use these tools to control the curvature of a geometry as it relaxes.  In performing these experiments, we will draw from a few different sources of inspiration.  

One is the emerging field of [Discrete Differential Geometry](http://ddg.cs.columbia.edu/), which seeks to define ways of measuring curvature in a setting where all the peices of your geometry are locally triangles in a mesh.  

Another perspective is furnished by the concept of [zippergons]({{ site.baseurl}}/public/img/thurston-zippergon.pdf), i.e. perhaps there is an interesting family of "flat" manifolds to study that are not [polyhedra](https://stemkoski.github.io/Three.js/Polyhedra.html).  One cute application of this idea is the [2014 World Cup Ball](http://www.science4all.org/le-nguyen-hoang/brazuca/).

Finally, there are some rich explorations going on following the line of thought set out in D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson's [On Growth and Form]({{ site.baseurl}}/public/img/ongrowthform00thom.djvu).  In particular, my favorites of these are the following two explorations:
